# Adversarial Deepfakes Defense Dataset


This dataset is consisted of five parts, each part includes the face images extracted from each kind of videos, every 50 frames. 

The first part is original-dfvideos-faces, the faces in this part are extracted from original-dfvideos. And original-dfvideos is consisted of the first 100 videos (with IDs 001-100) from each of the four forgery types (Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap, NeuralTextures) in the FaceForensics++ (FF++) dataset[1]. 

The second part is w-adv-dfvideos-XceptionNet-faces, , the faces in this part are extracted from w-adv-dfvideos-XceptionNet. And w-adv-dfvideos-XceptionNet is consisted of the videos generated via white-box attack(Fast Gradient Sign Method in [2]) to videos in original-dfvideos using XceptionNet[3] as victim model.

The third part is b-adv-dfvideos-XceptionNet-faces, , the faces in this part are extracted from b-adv-dfvideos-XceptionNet. And b-adv-dfvideos-XceptionNet is consisted of the videos generated via black-box attack(Natural Evolutionary Strategies in [2]) to videos in original-dfvideos using XceptionNet[3] as victim model.

The fourth part is w-adv-dfvideos-MesoNet-faces, , the faces in this part are extracted from w-adv-dfvideos-MesoNet. And w-adv-dfvideos-MesoNet is consisted of the videos generated via white-box attack(Fast Gradient Sign Method in [2]) to videos in original-dfvideos using MesoNet[4] as victim model.

The fifth part is b-adv-dfvideos-MesoNet-faces, , the faces in this part are extracted from b-adv-dfvideos-MesonNet. And b-adv-dfvideos-MesoNet is consisted of the videos generated via black-box attack(Natural Evolutionary Strategies in [2]) to videos in original-dfvideos using MesoNet[4] as victim model.
